I got the API keys by going to 
OpenWeatherMap API and signed up for an API
and to Google to do the same

These keys were then copied into my config.py file for use in the weather.py and vacation.py juypter notebooks. This file has been copied into the repo.

I have included folders : output_data for csv data for the initialise randome selection of 500 cities and then made copies of the various data frames in csv format as its hard to see all the data in the Juypter notebook.

The other folder is Images which contain screen shots of the plots and also the google maps.

I enjoyed the vaction.py work as seeing results in a map which you could zoom in on was satisfying.

I did do pip install citipy and had a look at the contents, But I found that using the data in the cities.csv file to get the cityname, latitude and longtitude which then allowed me to interrogate the two api's to get the relevant weather information and to then plot them in google maps.

Also I did not include the City datetime as I did not use it in any of my analysis , plotting or mapping.
